# AlexQkit

## Quantum Computer Simulator 


### **Abstract**
The quantum simulator AlexQkit is built with several features to facilitate the operations for the users. Those features help the user to view and edit Qasm code. Further, one can deduce quantum circuits from Boolean algebra expressions, repeat columns as a loop, add a certain condition to the wires, add customized gates, trace the circuit at a specific point.

### Technologies
1. Vue.js 
2. Python 
3. Flask 
4. Qiskit
